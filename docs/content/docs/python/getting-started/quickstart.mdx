# Quickstart

This guide will help you get up and running with the DFlow Python SDK in just a few minutes.

## Initialize the Client

```python
from dflow import DFlowClient

# Create a client instance
client = DFlowClient()
```

## Fetch Markets

```python
# Get all active markets
markets = client.markets.get_markets(status="active")

for market in markets.markets[:5]:
    print(f"{market.ticker}: Yes ${market.yes_bid} / ${market.yes_ask}")
```

## Get Market Details

```python
# Get a specific market by ID
market = client.markets.get_market("market-id-here")
print(f"Market: {market.ticker}")
print(f"Status: {market.status}")
```

## Fetch Orderbook

```python
# Get orderbook for a market
orderbook = client.orderbook.get_orderbook("market-id-here")

print("Bids:")
for level in orderbook.bids[:3]:
    print(f"  ${level.price} - {level.quantity} contracts")

print("Asks:")
for level in orderbook.asks[:3]:
    print(f"  ${level.price} - {level.quantity} contracts")
```

## Browse Events

```python
# Get upcoming events
events = client.events.get_events(status="active")

for event in events.events[:5]:
    print(f"{event.ticker}: {event.title}")
```

## Real-time WebSocket Updates

```python
import asyncio
from dflow import DFlowClient

async def main():
    client = DFlowClient()
    
    async with client.ws as ws:
        # Subscribe to price updates
        await ws.subscribe_prices(["market-id-1", "market-id-2"])
        
        # Listen for updates
        async for price in ws.prices():
            print(f"Market {price.market_id}: ${price.yes_price}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Get a Swap Quote

```python
# Get a quote for buying YES tokens
quote = client.swap.get_quote(
    market_id="market-id-here",
    side="yes",
    size=100,  # 100 contracts
    type="buy"
)

print(f"Average price: ${quote.avg_price}")
print(f"Total cost: ${quote.total_cost}")
```

## Execute a Swap (Requires Wallet)

```python
from solders.keypair import Keypair
from dflow import sign_and_send_transaction

# Load your wallet
keypair = Keypair.from_base58_string("your-private-key")

# Get swap transaction
swap_response = client.swap.create_swap(
    market_id="market-id-here",
    side="yes",
    size=100,
    type="buy",
    user_public_key=str(keypair.pubkey())
)

# Sign and send
signature = sign_and_send_transaction(
    swap_response.transaction,
    keypair
)
print(f"Transaction: {signature}")
```

## Error Handling

```python
from dflow import DFlowClient, DFlowApiError

client = DFlowClient()

try:
    market = client.markets.get_market("invalid-id")
except DFlowApiError as e:
    print(f"API Error: {e.message}")
    print(f"Status Code: {e.status_code}")
```

## Using Pagination

```python
from dflow import collect_all, paginate

# Collect all markets (auto-paginate)
all_markets = collect_all(
    lambda cursor: client.markets.get_markets(cursor=cursor)
)

# Or iterate page by page
for page in paginate(lambda c: client.markets.get_markets(cursor=c)):
    for market in page.markets:
        print(market.ticker)
```
