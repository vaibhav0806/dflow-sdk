---

# Installation

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- A Solana wallet (for trading operations)

## Package Managers

### pip

```bash
pip install dflow-sdk
```

### uv (Recommended)

```bash
uv add dflow-sdk
```

### poetry

```bash
poetry add dflow-sdk
```

## Dependencies

The SDK automatically installs the following dependencies:

- `solana` - Solana Python SDK
- `solders` - Solana data structures
- `httpx` - Modern HTTP client
- `websockets` - WebSocket support
- `pydantic` - Data validation and serialization

## Verify Installation

```python
from dflow import DFlowClient, __version__

print(f"DFlow SDK version: {__version__}")

# Create a client instance
client = DFlowClient()
print("✓ SDK installed successfully!")
```

## Environment Configuration

### API Keys (Optional)

For authenticated endpoints, set your API key:

```python
from dflow import DFlowClient

client = DFlowClient()
client.set_api_key("your-api-key")
```

Or via environment variable:

```bash
export DFLOW_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

### Production vs Development

By default, the SDK connects to the development environment. For production:

```python
from dflow import DFlowClient, DFlowEnvironment

# Production environment
client = DFlowClient(environment=DFlowEnvironment.PRODUCTION)

# Development environment (default)
client = DFlowClient(environment=DFlowEnvironment.DEVELOPMENT)
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have the SDK installed, check out the [Quickstart Guide](/docs/python/getting-started/quickstart) to start building.
