---

# Installation

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- A Solana wallet (for trading operations)

## Package Managers

### pip

```bash
pip install dflow-sdk
```

### uv (Recommended)

```bash
uv add dflow-sdk
```

### poetry

```bash
poetry add dflow-sdk
```

## Dependencies

The SDK automatically installs the following dependencies:

- `solana` - Solana Python SDK
- `solders` - Solana data structures
- `httpx` - Modern HTTP client
- `websockets` - WebSocket support
- `pydantic` - Data validation and serialization

## Verify Installation

```python
from dflow import DFlowClient, __version__

print(f"DFlow SDK version: {__version__}")

# Create a client instance
client = DFlowClient()
print("✓ SDK installed successfully!")
```

## Environment Configuration

### Development vs Production

The SDK defaults to development environment, which requires no API key:

```python
from dflow import DFlowClient

# Development (default) - no API key required
# Uses dev-*.dflow.net endpoints for testing with real capital
client = DFlowClient()

# Equivalent to:
client = DFlowClient(environment="development")

# Production - requires API key
# Uses *.dflow.net endpoints for production deployments
client = DFlowClient(environment="production", api_key="your-api-key")
```

### API Keys

For production or higher rate limits, set your API key:

```python
from dflow import DFlowClient

# At initialization
client = DFlowClient(api_key="your-api-key")

# Or set it later
client = DFlowClient()
client.set_api_key("your-api-key")
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have the SDK installed, check out the [Quickstart Guide](/docs/python/getting-started/quickstart) to start building.
