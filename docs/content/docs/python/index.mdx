- **Async Support** - Both sync and async APIs available

## Quick Start

```python
from dflow import DFlowClient

# Initialize the client
client = DFlowClient()

# Get active markets
markets = client.markets.get_markets(status="active")

# Get a specific market's orderbook
orderbook = client.orderbook.get_orderbook(market_id="some-market-id")

# Subscribe to real-time updates
async with client.ws as ws:
    await ws.subscribe_prices(["market-id-1", "market-id-2"])
    async for price in ws.prices():
        print(f"Price update: {price}")
```
