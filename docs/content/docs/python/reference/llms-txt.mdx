# LLMs.txt

The DFlow Python SDK documentation is available in a machine-readable format optimized for Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI assistants.

## What is LLMs.txt?

LLMs.txt is a standardized format for providing documentation to AI assistants. It allows tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, and other AI-powered development tools to better understand and assist with your DFlow SDK usage.

## Access the Documentation

The Python SDK documentation is available at:

```
https://dflow-sdk.vercel.app/docs/python/llms.txt
```

## Usage with AI Assistants

### With Cursor

In Cursor, you can add the llms.txt URL as a documentation source:

1. Open Cursor Settings
2. Navigate to "Features" → "Docs"
3. Add `https://dflow-sdk.vercel.app/docs/python/llms.txt` as a documentation source

### With ChatGPT / Claude

You can paste the llms.txt content directly into your conversation or reference the URL:

```
Please read the DFlow Python SDK documentation from:
https://dflow-sdk.vercel.app/docs/python/llms.txt

Then help me with [your question]
```

### With Custom AI Tools

If you're building AI-powered tools, you can fetch the documentation programmatically:

```python
import httpx

response = httpx.get('https://dflow-sdk.vercel.app/docs/python/llms.txt')
docs = response.text

# Use docs in your AI context
```

## Content Structure

The llms.txt file includes:

- **SDK Overview** — Introduction and installation instructions
- **Table of Contents** — All available documentation pages
- **Full Documentation** — Complete reference for all APIs

## Benefits
